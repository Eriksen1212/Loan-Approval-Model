#Loan Approval & Delinquency Prediction Model

Overview:
Developed a predictive model that evaluates a user's financial information to determine whether a loan should be approved or rejected and estimates the probability of delinquency. The model aims to reduce credit risk and assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

Key Features:

Accepts user-provided personal and financial data to assess credit risk.
Predicts loan outcomes: approval, rejection, or the likelihood of delinquency.
Evaluates model performance using multiple metrics including Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score, Precision, and Recallâ€”with a particular focus on ROC-AUC for comprehensive performance assessment.
Supports scenario planning to help financial institutions manage and mitigate potential credit risks.
